## Usage

SaaSential is designed to be easily customizable. You can modify the components and API routes to suit your needs. Here are some common tasks you might want to perform:

### Adding New Routes

To add a new route, navigate to the `pages/api` directory and create a new file. For example, to create a new API endpoint for user data, you might create `pages/api/user.js`.

### Customizing UI Components

The UI components are located in the `components` directory. You can easily modify existing components or create new ones using ShadCN-UI.

### Integrating Payment Processing

To set up Stripe, follow the instructions in the Stripe documentation. You will need to add your API keys to the `.env` file.
